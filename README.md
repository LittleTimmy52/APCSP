# AP Computer Science Principals
## Purpose
The purpose of this repo is to house all my code from my APCSP classes. Now I did take this
cource a year prior to the creation of this repo so there probly will be no more than the
initial commit. Also this may not have all my code as it is the code that I kept (all be it
majority) in addition to code that may or may not have been actually assigned.

## Quick note
The AP create task is written in lua since I had the choise to use any language I so choose.
Also there was another one done in Unity, but that has its own repo so it does not need to go
here.
